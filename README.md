Here we try to implement reinforcement learning to make a gearsbot robot solve a maze on its own. 

To run this project do the following steps: 

1. Download robot.py, MazeRobot.json, and mazeMap_config.json
2. Open https://gears.aposteriori.com.sg/
3. upload the robot.py file from the python tab, MazeRobot.json from the robot tab and the mazeMap_config.json from the world tab.
4. Go to the simulator and run.
